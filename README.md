# PDA-Grammar-Transformer

This project, titled PDA-Grammar-Transformer, involves constructing a pushdown automaton (PDA) from a given context-free grammar (CFG) and verifying their properties. It allows users to read a grammar and a pushdown automaton from files, verify their correctness, simplify the grammar, and generate words based on the grammar. Additionally, the system provides functionality to print both the automaton and the grammar in a readable format, making it easier for users to interact with and understand these formal language constructs.

The project is organized into several key files. The Gramatica.h and Gramatica.cpp files define and implement the Grammar class, which handles operations related to context-free grammars. This class includes methods for verifying the grammar, simplifying it, and generating words. The grammar is read from Gramatica.txt, which contains definitions for non-terminal symbols, terminal symbols, the start symbol, and production rules. The Grammar class ensures the grammar is correctly formed, simplifies it by removing unnecessary symbols, and can generate words based on its rules.

The PushDownAutomaton.h and PushDownAutomaton.cpp files define and implement the PushDownAutomaton class, which manages the properties and operations of the pushdown automaton. This class includes methods for reading the automaton from a file, verifying its correctness, printing it, and checking if it is deterministic. The automaton is read from Automat.txt, which includes states, input symbols, stack symbols, transition functions, the start state, and the set of accepting states. The PushDownAutomaton class ensures the automaton adheres to the specified definitions and can be correctly processed.

The Source.cpp file contains the main logic for user interaction, providing a menu-driven interface that allows users to choose between different operations such as displaying the grammar, generating words, simplifying the grammar, and displaying the automaton. This file coordinates the reading of the grammar and automaton definitions, verifies their correctness, and facilitates user interactions through a series of prompts and outputs.

The project is designed to help users understand and manipulate context-free grammars and pushdown automata effectively. By providing tools to verify, simplify, and generate words from grammars, as well as to verify and print automata, the system offers a comprehensive framework for exploring these formal language constructs. This makes it an invaluable educational resource for those studying formal languages and automata theory.
